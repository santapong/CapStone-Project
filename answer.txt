This text appears to be a section from a research paper or academic article. It discusses several aspects of a few-shot object recognition system, including:

1. Comparison with Prototypical Networks: The authors compare their system with Prototypical Networks, which are a state-of-the-art approach for few-shot learning.
2. Qualitative evaluation with t-SNE scatter plots: This section describes an experiment where the authors visualize the feature representations learned by their system and Prototypical Networks using t-SNE scatter plots.
3. Few-shot benchmark of Bharath & Girshick [4]: The authors evaluate their system on a few-shot learning benchmark proposed by Bharath and Girshick, using improved evaluation metrics proposed by Wang et al.
4. Comparison with prior and concurrent work: The authors compare their full system (Cosine Classiﬁer & Att. Weight Gen entry) against other state-of-the-art approaches, including Prototypical Networks.

The main conclusions drawn from this section are:

* The authors' system achieves better few-shot object recognition performance than Prototypical Networks.
* The feature extractor learned by the authors' system generalizes better to unseen categories than Prototypical Networks.
* The full system (Cosine Classiﬁer & Att. Weight Gen entry) outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Overall, this section presents experimental results and comparisons that demonstrate the effectiveness of the authors' few-shot object recognition system.The text appears to be a portion of a research paper or academic writing related to deep learning and classification tasks. The main topic discussed in this section seems to be the development of a novel approach for handling few-shot learning problems, where the model needs to adapt to new categories with limited data.

The key contributions and innovations presented in this section are:

1. **Cosine similarity operator**: The authors propose using a cosine similarity operator instead of the dot product operation to compute the classiﬁcation scores. This modification helps reduce the impact of the magnitude of the weight vectors on the classification scores, allowing for more uniform learning across different categories.

2. **L2 normalization**: The use of L2 normalization (also known as Euclidean norm) is employed to ensure that the feature vector and the classiﬁcation weight vector have unit length. This step helps in stabilizing the gradient during training and prevents overfitting.

3. **ReLU removal after hidden layers**: The authors decide to remove the ReLU activation function after the last hidden layer, instead relying on the cosine similarity operator for classification. This approach allows for a more direct comparison between different classes using their cosine similarities.

The proposed solution aims to improve the performance and robustness of deep learning models when dealing with few-shot learning problems by providing a more uniform way of computing classiﬁcation scores and adapting weights based on input data.
